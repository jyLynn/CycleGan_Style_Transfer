# Chinese Landscape Painting Style Transfer based on CycleGAN
Transform modern photos into traditional Chinese landscape paintings using deep learning.


## 🌟 Project Overview
This project leverages CycleGAN to perform unpaired image-to-image translation, turning modern scenery images into Chinese landscape painting style. The model captures traditional aesthetics—such as brushstroke textures and structural abstraction—while preserving content and composition.

Lead Institution: MIT (Instructor: Prof. Mark Vogelsberger)

Paper Accepted: International Conference on Software Engineering and Machine Learning

## 🎯 Objectives
Recreate the visual charm of traditional Chinese art using AI.

Explore innovative applications of deep learning in cultural preservation.

Improve structure and edge clarity in stylized outputs through advanced techniques.

## 🧠 Key Techniques
### CycleGAN Model (PyTorch)
Implemented CycleGAN architecture for unpaired image translation.

Trained on curated datasets of modern natural images and Chinese landscape paintings.

### Structure Enhancement with HED
Integrated Holistically Nested Edge Detection (HED) to improve structural fidelity in output images.

Enhanced contour retention and line clarity, critical for aesthetic preservation.

### Web Platform Deployment
Developed a user-friendly web-based interface to showcase results.

Enables users to upload photos and view stylized outputs in real time.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Framework: PyTorch

Models: CycleGAN, HED

Languages: Python, HTML/CSS/JS (for web demo)

Visualization: OpenCV, Matplotlib

Deployment: Flask / Streamlit (selectable based on your actual implementation)

## 🖼️ Results
Outputs exhibit brush-style textures, ink-wash gradients, and abstract compositions.

Preserved key content structure while applying aesthetic transformations.

Recognized for creative integration of AI and cultural heritage.
